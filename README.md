## âœ¨ What is Spellbook?

**Spellbook.sh** is a tiny command-line helper that displays categorized cheat sheets for essential dev tools like Git, Python, Bash, and VS Code.

Itâ€™s a companion to [Codemancer](https://github.com/AndreeaSofia/codemancer), my first project, and just like that one, I made this for myself, really. I wanted a place to store the most useful commands I constantly forgetâ€¦ and I wanted it to be terminal-native, no fuss.

You can expand it easily, personalize it, or even pass it on to someone else starting their own dev journey.
